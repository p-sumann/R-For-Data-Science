# PCA looks to find a low- dimensional representation of the 
# observations that explain a good 
# fraction of the variance;

# Clustering looks to find 
# homogeneous subgroups among 
# the observations or cases.


# In K-means clustering, we seek 
# to partition the observations 
# into a pre-specified number of 
# clusters.


# On the other hand, in 
# hierarchical clustering, we do 
# not know in advance how many 
# clusters we want and we use 
# “dendogram” to find the 
# number of clusters for the data
