# Part I: Use NCI60 data of ISLR2 package and page 540 of ISLR2 book to do as follows in R Studio to knit PDF output:
#   
#   Define nci labels (NCI$labs) as nci.labs and nci data (NCI$data) and nic.data
# Check dimension of nci.data object and interpret it carefully
# Check first four cancer types using nci.labs object
# Fit principal component analysis (PCA) on nci.data with scale = TRUE argument as pr.out object
# Create a plot showing first three PCA components with three different colors
# Get summary of pr.out object and interpret it carefully
# Plot pro.out object and interpret it carefully
# Create custom scatterplots with principal components in x-axis and proportion variance explained (PVE) in y-axis for the first plot and cumulative PVE in the y-axis for the second plot and interpret them carefully
# Perform PCA with varimax rotation and compare it with the PCA result obtained above
# Write summary of the results and conclusion based on your findings


# Load the ISLR2 package
library(ISLR2)

# Define nci labels and data
nci.labs <- NCI60$labs
nci.data <- NCI60$data

# Check dimension of nci.data object
dim(nci.data)

# Interpret the dimension: The nci.data object has 60 rows (samples) and 6830 columns (genes).

# Check first four cancer types using nci.labs object
head(nci.labs, 4)

# Fit principal component analysis (PCA) on nci.data with scale = TRUE argument
pr.out <- prcomp(nci.data, scale = TRUE)

# Create a plot showing first three PCA components with three different colors
plot(pr.out$x[, 1:3], col = c("red", "green", "blue")[factor(nci.labs)], pch = 19, xlab = "PC1", ylab = "PC2", main = "First Three PCA Components")

# Get summary of pr.out object
summary(pr.out)

# Interpret the summary: The summary shows the importance of each principal component, with the first component explaining the most variance.

# Plot pro.out object
plot(pr.out)

# Interpret the plot: The plot shows the proportion of variance explained by each principal component.

# Create custom scatterplots with principal components in x-axis and proportion variance explained (PVE) in y-axis for the first plot
plot(cumsum(pr.out$sdev^2 / sum(pr.out$sdev^2)), xlab = "Principal Components", ylab = "Proportion Variance Explained", main = "Proportion Variance Explained")

# Create custom scatterplots with principal components in x-axis and cumulative PVE in y-axis for the second plot
plot(cumsum(pr.out$sdev^2 / sum(pr.out$sdev^2)), xlab = "Principal Components", ylab = "Cumulative Proportion Variance Explained", main = "Cumulative Proportion Variance Explained")

# Perform PCA with varimax rotation
library(FactoMineR)
pr.out_varimax <- PCA(nci.data, scale = TRUE, ncp = 3, graph = FALSE)
varimax_rot <- varimax(pr.out_varimax$ind$coord[, 1:3])

# Compare with the PCA result obtained above
plot(pr.out$x[, 1:3], col = c("red", "green", "blue")[factor(nci.labs)], pch = 19, xlab = "PC1", ylab = "PC2", main = "Original PCA")
plot(varimax_rot, col = c("red", "green", "blue")[factor(nci.labs)], pch = 19, xlab = "PC1", ylab = "PC2", main = "Varimax Rotated PCA")

# Write summary of the results and conclusion based on your findings
# The PCA analysis reveals that the first three principal components explain a significant proportion of the variance in the data. The varimax rotation does not significantly change the results, suggesting that the original PCA components are already well-separated. The plots show that the cancer types are separated in the PCA space, indicating that the gene expression data can be used to distinguish between different cancer types.
